**What kind of control would you like in Streamer.bot to interact with your community?**
Be as detailed as you can about how the control would operate, what kinds of interactions would happen, etc. I'll follow up in comments to clarify the idea with you.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Does something like this already exist and you want it just a little bit different? Or is this something completely new to build?

**Tell me about your stream setup**
If you're a streamer, tell me about your Streamer.bot version, your OBS version, any other helpful pieces of information (are you an affiliate/partner on Twitch, or how big your YouTube channel is, etc.)
