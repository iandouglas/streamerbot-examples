# Subscriber duration giveaways

On my channel, if you are a subscriber, I start building a small 3D-printed cosplay helmet, and as you stay subscribed, it gets airbrushed with more detail, until at the 6-month mark, I will send the mini helmet to you as a thank-you for subscribing.

This system needs an overhaul.

I want Streamer.bot to automatically track how many times you have re-subbed, and try to whisper to you when you resubscribe to let you know the next stage:
    - month 1: "Thanks for subscribing! You're now eligible for a 3D-printed mini helmet! Please go to cool3dthings.com and pick which helmet you want and reply here with the name of the helmet."
    - month 2: "Thanks for resubscribing! It's time to get a base coat of paint on that mini helmet, please reply with a base color over which we'll be painting all other detail."
    - etc.
    - month 6: "You've subscribed for 6 months!! Please reply with your mailing address so I can send your mini helmet. If you are international, I'll ask you to split the shipping fees with me, or you can reply asking me to add it to our next giveaway."

Alternate idea:

- I may want to track this on a cumulative 500-bit basis, so every amount of bits a person cheers up to a 500-bit increment will autoatically advance their helmet to the next state. This may be more convenient for people who subscribe to Twitch Turbo and don't want to subscribe but still want the mini helmet.
    - the drawback here is if someone immediately drops 3000 bits and wants the helmet immediately, there's some amount of lead time to choose the helmet and get it painted, etc.
