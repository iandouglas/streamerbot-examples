# Automated control to flag someone as a VIP

I'd like to build a mechanism to allow a user to become a VIP for a period of time.

We should do this in a way that benefits the streamer, like a bit redeem or youtube control. For users who can't afford to pay actual money, if they follow your channel long enough to accumulate a quantity of channel points maybe they can redeem those to a VIP for a while (or permanent).

## Thoughts

We should probably build this in a way that creates a "VIP" user group in Streamer.bot, and not rely solely on Twitch's VIP status control. This would allow YouTube streamers to use this control as well and would make it easier to check VIP status for other commands/actions that only VIPs could do.


## Coming Soon

If you'd like this built sooner than later, please visit [my Discord community](https://tig.fyi/discord) and upvote this in the `#streamerbot-ideas` channel.
