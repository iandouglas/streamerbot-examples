# Giveaway prizes from Google Sheets

Inspired by [DKlarations](https://twitch.tv/DKlarations)

Track my giveaway items (game codes, shirts, pins, stickers, etc) in a Google Sheets document and have Streamer.bot randomly choose an item from the spreadsheet to give away.

This will require the document to have two worksheets, one to pick the prizes from, and another for the streamer to move the row to once given away to include a username etc.

Ideas:
- it would be nice to have Streamer.bot automatically send a whisper to the winner with the game code and where to redeem, or to remind them to submit their mailing address for physical items, otherwise we'll need a form for them to fill out with their contact info etc.
