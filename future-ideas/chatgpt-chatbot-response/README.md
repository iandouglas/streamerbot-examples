# ChatGPT chatbot response

This was based on another developer's work, House of Jacobs, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXqxATLJva0

I streamlined it, added more arguments, to make it more user friendly, and removed the Speaker.bot integration.


## Coming Soon

If you'd like this built sooner than later, please visit [my Discord community](https://tig.fyi/discord) and upvote this in the `#streamerbot-ideas` channel.
