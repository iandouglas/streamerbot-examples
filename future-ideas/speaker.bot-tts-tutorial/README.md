# Speaker.bot using Google AI voices

Inspired by many other TTS systems that allow you to pick celebrity voices, I'd like to be able to use Google's AI voices for my Speaker.bot.

We examined some AI generated voices for recording some small clips like when someone follows my channel, but we weren't sure how well it would work for near-real-time TTS for a channel point redeem.

I'd like to build a step-by-step tutorial on how to use Google's AI voices for your Speaker.bot, and connect it to a channel point redeem or a bit redeem, or both.

## this will cost real money

Google is generous with quotas, but their APIs can cost actual money.


## Coming Soon

If you'd like this built sooner than later, please visit [my Discord community](https://tig.fyi/discord) and upvote this in the `#streamerbot-ideas` channel.
