# Streamer.bot Examples

This is a respository of things I've built or tweaked for [Streamer.bot](Streamer.bot) for myself or other streamers on Twitch/YouTube.

## How to use it

Each folder will have a README with instructions, and an 'import_code.txt' file containing the import text that will work in Streamer.bot 0.2.x. I will not be generating exports for Streamer.bot 0.1.x. But each folder will also include any C# code needed to build your own actions, subactions, etc along the way or if you want to make any modifications/improvements. Please make a pull request to the code if you add something helpful!

## Yes, it's open-source

If you find a way to improve it, please share it back here. I'm not an expert at C# or Streamer.bot, I hack things 'til they work then move on to the next thing.

## Yes, I'm here to help

Probably on my [live stream](https://twitch.tv/iandouglas736) but you can contact me as `iandouglas736` on Twitter, Discord, etc.

Check out my [Discord server](https://tig.fyi/discord) and look for the `#streamerbot-ideas` channel for things I'm planning to build, or for what I HAVE built.

## Warranty, etc.

No warranty. You're on your own. I disclaim all responsibility if you use any of my code.
