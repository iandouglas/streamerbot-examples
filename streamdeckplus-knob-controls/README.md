# Elgato Streamdeck+ Knob Controls

Inspired by [Nutty](https://twitch.tv/Nutty)

Nutty recently released a YouTube short where he showed off how he can immediately trigger showing an ad on Twitch by turning a Streamdeck+ knob to control the ad length of 60sec, 90sec, 2min, 3min and then click the knob to play the ads. He said in the video that he had to program it all himself but didn't appear to share the code anywhere.

I'd like to build this control myself, not just for ads, but for other kinds of controls, and open-source it for everyone.


## Coming Soon

If you'd like this built sooner than later, please visit [my Discord community](https://tig.fyi/discord) and upvote this in the `#streamerbot-ideas` channel.
